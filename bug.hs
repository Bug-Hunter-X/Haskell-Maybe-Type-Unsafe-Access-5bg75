This Haskell code attempts to perform an unsafe operation on a Maybe type without proper handling, leading to a runtime exception.  The function `processMaybe` tries to access the value inside the `Maybe` without checking if it contains a `Just` value. If it contains a `Nothing`, the program will crash.

```haskell
processMaybe :: Maybe Int -> Int
processMaybe x = fromJust x + 10

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = processMaybe Nothing
  print result
```
